name: academic-writing
description: Use when planning, drafting, revising, or reviewing a research paper with venue, paper type, domain evidence adapter, metric, claim-evidence, citation, reviewer-risk, or style constraints. Also trigger on general paper-writing requests even without these terms, such as writing a paper from scratch, drafting or restructuring a section, building a paper outline/framework, polishing or compressing prose, and Chinese phrasings like 学术写作、科研写作、论文写作、写论文、写paper、写一篇论文、帮我写论文、搭论文框架、起草论文、润色论文、改论文、写引言/摘要/方法/实验/相关工作/结论、投稿前自检. This skill writes and revises the paper only; it does not run experiments or conduct research.

# Academic Writing — Router

## ⚠️ Scope: Writing Only, Never Research

**This skill produces and revises the paper artifact. It does not do the research.**
It improves expression, structure, section logic, claim-evidence alignment, reviewer-facing
framing, figures/tables presentation, and venue fit. It MUST NOT, by default:

- change the research idea, problem scope, method mechanism, or contribution type,
- design, run, or modify experiments, environments, or pipelines,
- invent, alter, or "improve" results, numbers, baselines, ablations, or datasets,
- fabricate citations, evidence, or experimental detail.

If correct writing appears to require changing any of the above, **stop and ask the user**.
If the user asks to "optimize the idea" or change results while using this skill, get explicit
confirmation first; otherwise mark the issue as an `idea-level risk` or `needs evidence` (the
status vocabulary is defined in `static/core/contract.md`), keep the wording bounded, and continue
with writing-only revisions. Unsupported claims are
weakened, marked `needs evidence`, or removed — never strengthened to look better.

This skill is split into two layers:

- A **static layer** under `static/` that holds versioned, reusable content fragments (core stance,
  gates, contract, and per-workflow execution rules).
- A **dynamic layer** (this file plus `manifest.yaml`) that detects the request's axes and loads
  only the fragments needed for the current job. Section guides, check references, figure
  references, domain adapters, and style references stay in on-demand `references/`.

Do not apply the writing logic from memory or from this router. Always load fragments from disk
as described below.

## ⚠️ Critical Decision Rule: STOP, NEVER GUESS

**This is the highest-priority rule. It overrides all other instructions, defaults, and
autonomy settings. No exception.**

When the agent encounters a decision that materially affects the paper — paper identity,
core claims, evidence boundary, key terminology, evidence conflicts, venue/template,
section structure, or figure/table plan — **it MUST stop and ask the user. It MUST NOT
guess, assume, default silently, or proceed past the decision.**

Read `static/core/gates.md` for the full rule. The short version: if guessing wrong would
cause a false claim, wrong paper identity, wrong terminology, or a large downstream rewrite,
**stop. Ask. Wait for the user's explicit response. Do not proceed without it.**

## ⚠️ Interaction Language Rule

**The agent MUST mirror the user's interaction language in all conversation output.**
This includes clarification questions, checkpoint summaries, status updates, policy
rationale, self-review notes, and warnings. If the user writes in Chinese (with or
without English technical terms), the agent MUST respond in Chinese. File paths,
LaTeX commands, BibTeX keys, and code remain in their original language. Paper prose
remains English by default. This rule is not overridden by any other policy.

## Routing Protocol

Follow these steps every time the skill is invoked.

### 1. Load the manifest and the core layer

Read [manifest.yaml](manifest.yaml). It declares the axes (`workflow`, `venue_kind`, `venue`,
`paper_type`),
the allowed values, and the file paths each value maps to.

Also read every file listed under `always_load` (`static/core/stance.md`, `static/core/gates.md`,
`static/core/contract.md`). These hold the language policy, integrity rules, output contract,
checkpoint semantics, clarification protocol, and writing contract that apply to every writing job.

### 2. Route into exactly one workflow — a blocking gate

Decide the `workflow` value from the user request. Every request must be routed before work begins:

- **Full Draft Workflow** (`full-draft`): user provides a workspace or asks for a complete first
  paper draft from project materials.
- **Draft Revision Workflow** (`draft-revision`): user provides existing prose and asks to rewrite,
  polish, diagnose, review, compress, weaken claims, or improve flow.

If ambiguous, ask one concise question and stop. After routing, load the matching workflow fragment
(`static/workflow/full-draft.md` or `static/workflow/draft-revision.md`).

### 3. Detect the remaining axis values in order

For each remaining axis in the manifest (`venue_kind`, `venue`, `paper_type`), decide the value
using the manifest's `detect:` hint and the user's input. State the detected values briefly so the
user can correct them cheaply.

- `venue_kind`: decide first. Use `journal` only when the user explicitly says journal article /
  journal paper or names a journal venue/track. If the user does not explicitly specify journal,
  default to `conference`.
- `venue`: decide second. For unspecified conference targets, use `generic`; for explicit but
  unmodeled journal targets, use `journal`.
- `paper_type`: decide third from workspace evidence and the selected `venue_kind`; conference uses
  the top-level paper-type profiles, journal uses `journal-*` profiles. Default to `generic` for
  conference and `journal-generic` for journal.

### 4. Build the paper using the loaded material

Apply the loaded material in this order:

1. Core contract (`static/core/contract.md`) — establish paper identity, core story, claims and
   evidence boundary, key terminology, and venue/format contract.
2. Core gates (`static/core/gates.md`) — apply clarification protocol, mandatory checkpoint
   semantics, and workflow planning protocol.
3. Core stance (`static/core/stance.md`) — apply language policy, output contract, and integrity
   rules.
4. Workflow fragment — the exclusive full-draft or draft-revision execution rules.

The Full Draft Workflow follows this state machine:
`workspace → Writing Policy → user confirmation → Paper Framework → user confirmation → paper/`

### 5. Reach for references only when needed

The files under `references/` are deep references, not defaults. Open them on demand per the
`references.on_demand` table in the manifest. Typical triggers:

- Section drafting → `references/sections/<section>.md`
- **Journal gating (read before loading any `journal/` content):** the `references/sections/journal/`
  overlays, `references/paper-types/journal/`, `references/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`, and
  `references/checks/journal-submission-elements.md` are **journal-only**. Load them **only when
  `Venue Kind` is `journal`**. When `Venue Kind` is `conference`, do **not** load anything under
  those journal paths at all — the base section guides and conference paper-types are complete on
  their own. When `Venue Kind` is `journal`, load the base section guide first, then layer the
  matching `references/sections/journal/<section>.md` overlay on top (it states only the journal
  deltas; see `references/sections/journal/index.md`).
- Figure/table planning → `references/figures/figure-planning.md`
- Figure styling & code (mandatory before drawing any data-driven plot) →
  `references/figures/plot-style.md` (rcParams, colors, per–chart-type rules) and
  `references/figures/chart-patterns.md` (reusable plot helpers). Choose the color
  palette from the **data structure first** (categorical→qualitative, ordered→sequential,
  signed→diverging, one focus entity→hero-baseline), then render→inspect the PNG against
  the Display Review Gate before accepting a figure.
- Drafting or polishing English prose (apply while writing; verify in review) →
  `references/style/copyediting-standard.md` (formal register, no contractions, no
  possessive `'s` on names, simple words, abbreviations kept, LaTeX preserved, no added
  emphasis, no list-ification)
- Post-draft review (automatic after Full Draft) → `references/sections/paper-review.md`.
  Load it immediately after the first complete `paper/` draft exists; do not wait for
  the user to explicitly ask for review. The draft returned to the user is the
  reviewed-and-revised draft.
- Claim-evidence audit → `references/checks/claim-evidence.md`
- Citation integrity → `references/checks/citation-integrity.md`
- Final submission-readiness check → `references/checks/submission-readiness.md`
- Domain-specific evidence pressure → `references/domains/<domain>.md`
- Template selection → `templates/index.md`
- Reference paper style learning → `references/style/reference-paper-learning.md`

## Why This Split

- The static layer is versioned and reviewable. Adding a new paper type or venue is one new file
  plus one manifest line.
- The dynamic layer keeps each invocation cheap: only the fragments relevant to this draft enter
  context, instead of 1000+ lines of workflow and reference text.
- The router itself is short on purpose. Update fragments and references, not this file, when
  adding scope.
- This structure keeps routing, reusable fragments, and deep references separated so each invocation
  loads only the relevant material.
