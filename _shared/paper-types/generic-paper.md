# Generic Research Paper Type

Use this profile when the paper type is unknown, mixed, early-stage, or not well captured by the
other profiles. It follows a common research-paper structure while remaining neutral about
contribution type.

## Section Structure (Paper Framework hard default)

This file gives the **default section list, order, naming, count, and budget** for this paper type.
The Paper Framework stage treats it as a **hard default, not loose inspiration**: by default,
reproduce the section table below exactly (its section column, in order) and quote it as the canonical
list in the Paper Framework's "Structure vs paper-type profile" comparison. This file does not
prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims, evidence, or citations.

Deviate only when the actual contribution, evidence, venue requirement, or explicit user request
genuinely cannot fit this structure — never merely because another layout seems "cleaner" or "more
standard". Every split, merge, rename, addition, or reorder must be surfaced and approved at the Paper
Framework checkpoint; silent structural deviation is a workflow violation.

## Section And Page-Budget Reference

When no venue-specific budget is known, use the workflow's soft 6-8 main-text-page drafting budget
and treat 8 pages as an upper bound, not a venue limit.

## Priority Contract

- Primary core: Method / Approach / Design, or the section that carries the central contribution.
- Evidence core: Experiments / Evaluation / Analysis.
- Compress first: Conclusion, broad Related Work, optional Discussion, and secondary details that can
  move to appendix.
- Core floor: for an 8-page generic draft, keep the primary core at about 1.5-2.5 pages and avoid
  dropping below 1.25 pages unless the user explicitly approves the tradeoff.

| Order | Candidate section | Typical budget | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | 0.15-0.25 page | State task/problem, gap, contribution, main evidence, and scoped takeaway. |
| 1 | Introduction | 1.0-1.5 pages | Move from problem and motivation to gap, core idea, contribution summary, and evidence preview. |
| 2 | Related Work | 0.75-1.25 pages | Group relevant work by topic and clarify how the paper differs from the closest lines. |
| 3 | Method / Approach / Design | 1.5-2.5 pages | Explain the proposed approach, modules, workflow, design choices, or analytical setup. |
| 4 | Experiments / Evaluation / Analysis | 2.0-3.0 pages | Present setup, main evidence, comparisons, ablations or controls, qualitative examples, and limitations of evidence. |
| 5 | Discussion | 0.5-1.0 page | Interpret findings, tradeoffs, implications, and boundary conditions when not already covered elsewhere. |
| 6 | Conclusion | 0.25-0.5 page | Summarize the contribution and supported takeaway without adding new evidence. |
| End | Limitations | venue-dependent | State scope limits, assumptions, evidence gaps, risks, or deployment constraints. |
| Back | Appendix | outside main budget when allowed | Put extra details, prompts, proofs, extended tables, implementation notes, and additional examples here. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- If the contribution is clearly a method, system, benchmark/dataset, or survey, prefer the specific profile.
- If the paper is short, combine Discussion with Experiments or Conclusion.
- If the venue has strict page limits, prioritize Introduction, the core contribution section, and the evidence section.
