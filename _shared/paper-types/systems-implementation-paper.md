# Systems / Implementation Engineering Paper Type

Use this profile for papers whose main contribution is a working system, software/hardware module,
platform, runtime, deployment pipeline, engineering framework, or implementation strategy.

## Section Structure (Paper Framework hard default)

This file gives the **default section list, order, naming, count, and budget** for this paper type.
The Paper Framework stage treats it as a **hard default, not loose inspiration**: by default,
reproduce the section table below exactly (its section column, in order) and quote it as the canonical
list in the Paper Framework's "Structure vs paper-type profile" comparison. This file does not
prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims, evidence, or citations.

Deviate only when the actual contribution, evidence, venue requirement, or explicit user request
genuinely cannot fit this structure — never merely because another layout seems "cleaner" or "more
standard". Every split, merge, rename, addition, or reorder must be surfaced and approved at the Paper
Framework checkpoint; silent structural deviation is a workflow violation.

## Section And Page-Budget Reference

When no venue-specific budget is known, use the workflow's soft 6-8 main-text-page drafting budget
and treat 8 pages as an upper bound, not a venue limit.

## Priority Contract

- Primary core: System Design and Implementation.
- Evidence core: Results and Analysis.
- Compress first: Conclusion, broad Related Work, exhaustive API/configuration details, and
  secondary demos that can move to appendix.
- Core floor: for an 8-page generic/conference draft, keep System Design and Implementation at
  2.0-3.0 pages and never below 1.5 pages unless the user explicitly approves; for a short paper,
  preserve architecture, interfaces, data/control flow, and key tradeoffs.

| Order | Candidate section | Typical budget | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | 0.15-0.25 page | Summarize the engineering problem, system approach, achieved capability, and practical value. |
| 1 | Introduction | 1.0-1.5 pages | Motivate the real-world problem, requirements, gap in existing systems, target users, and contributions. |
| 2 | Related Work | 0.75-1.25 pages | Compare relevant systems, architectures, tools, or implementation strategies by capability and limitation. |
| 3 | System Design and Implementation | 2.0-3.0 pages | Describe architecture, module boundaries, interfaces, data/control flow, technical choices, and key implementation details. |
| 4 | Experimental Setup | 0.5-0.75 page | Define evaluation goals, environment, workloads, test cases, baselines, metrics, and configuration. |
| 5 | Results and Analysis | 1.5-2.25 pages | Evaluate functionality, reliability, efficiency, scalability, stability, resource use, and goal satisfaction. |
| 6 | Conclusion | 0.25-0.5 page | Summarize the system contribution and practical implications. |
| End | Limitations | venue-dependent | State deployment boundaries, assumptions, engineering tradeoffs, evaluation scope, and unsupported settings. |
| Back | Appendix | outside main budget when allowed | Put extended configuration, API details, extra experiments, logs, screenshots, and implementation notes here. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- If the system design is the core contribution, protect architecture diagrams and implementation space.
- If deployment evidence is central, reserve more space for workload design, operational constraints, and case studies.
- If the venue is short, combine Experimental Setup with Results and keep only the essential system internals in the main text.
