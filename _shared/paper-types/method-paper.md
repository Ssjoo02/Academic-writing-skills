# Algorithmic / Methodological Innovation Paper Type

Use this profile for papers whose main contribution is a new algorithm, model architecture,
training paradigm, objective, inference procedure, or methodological design.

## Section Structure (Paper Framework hard default)

This file gives the **default section list, order, naming, count, and budget** for this paper type.
The Paper Framework stage treats it as a **hard default, not loose inspiration**: by default,
reproduce the section table below exactly (its section column, in order) and quote it as the canonical
list in the Paper Framework's "Structure vs paper-type profile" comparison. This file does not
prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims, evidence, or citations.

Deviate only when the actual contribution, evidence, venue requirement, or explicit user request
genuinely cannot fit this structure — never merely because another layout seems "cleaner" or "more
standard". Every split, merge, rename, addition, or reorder must be surfaced and approved at the Paper
Framework checkpoint; silent structural deviation is a workflow violation.

## Section And Page-Budget Reference

When no venue-specific budget is known, use the workflow's soft 6-8 main-text-page drafting budget
and treat 8 pages as an upper bound, not a venue limit.

## Priority Contract

- Primary core: Method.
- Evidence core: Results and Analysis.
- Compress first: Conclusion, broad Related Work, secondary analysis, and implementation detail
  that can move to appendix.
- Core floor: for an 8-page generic/conference draft, keep Method at 2.0-3.0 pages and never below
  1.5 pages or roughly 25% of the main prose budget unless the user explicitly approves; for a
  4-page short paper, Method may shrink to about 0.8-1.0 pages with the omitted detail named in the
  framework.

| Order | Candidate section | Typical budget | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | 0.15-0.25 page | Summarize background, gap, method idea, main result, and scoped conclusion. |
| 1 | Introduction | 1.0-1.5 pages | Establish the problem, prior limitation, research question, core method insight, and contributions. |
| 2 | Related Work | 0.75-1.25 pages | Group related algorithms or methods by technical line and clarify the gap this method targets. |
| 3 | Method | 2.0-3.0 pages | Explain algorithm structure, architecture, training/inference flow, equations, pseudocode, and module rationale. |
| 4 | Experimental Setup | 0.5-0.75 page | State datasets, baselines, metrics, implementation settings, and hyperparameters needed for reproducibility. |
| 5 | Results and Analysis | 1.5-2.5 pages | Present main results, ablations, robustness checks, efficiency, qualitative analysis, and failure cases. |
| 6 | Conclusion | 0.25-0.5 page | Summarize the method contribution, strongest evidence, and future direction. |
| End | Limitations | venue-dependent | Discuss failure cases, compute/resource cost, assumptions, and settings where the method may not transfer. |
| Back | Appendix | outside main budget when allowed | Put long proofs, extra derivations, extra tables, implementation details, and extended qualitative examples here. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- If the method is mathematically heavy, reserve more Method or Appendix space for derivations and reduce Related Work.
- If the core claim depends on empirical gains, protect enough Results and Analysis space for ablation and failure analysis.
- If the venue has a required limitations or ethics section, account for it in the venue-aware Page Budget Summary.
