# Journal Application / Large-Scale Deployment Paper Type

Use this profile for journal papers whose main contribution is applying and scaling technology to a
real-world coverage gap, with resource construction, model scaling, and practical-impact evaluation.
Representative shape: JMLR large-scale applied projects (e.g., extending speech technology to 1,000+
languages: motivate the coverage gap, build the data/resource, scale the models, then evaluate
real-world impact against strong baselines and release artifacts).

## Section Structure (Paper Framework hard default)

This file gives the **default section list, order, naming, count, and budget** for this paper type.
The Paper Framework stage treats it as a **hard default, not loose inspiration**: by default,
reproduce the section table below exactly (its section column, in order) and quote it as the canonical
list in the Paper Framework's "Structure vs paper-type profile" comparison. This file does not
prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims, evidence, or citations.

Deviate only when the actual contribution, evidence, venue requirement, or explicit user request
genuinely cannot fit this structure — never merely because another layout seems "cleaner" or "more
standard". Every split, merge, rename, addition, or reorder must be surfaced and approved at the Paper
Framework checkpoint; silent structural deviation is a workflow violation.

## Length: Defer To The Venue Card

This is a journal paper, usually long because it spans data + models + evaluation. Take absolute
length from the venue card and plan sections as proportions first. Move full per-language / per-domain
tables and pipeline details to supplemental material. Also load
`references/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`.

## Priority Contract

- Primary core: Data / Resource Construction and Models / Scaling.
- Evidence core: Practical-Impact Evaluation.
- Compress first: Conclusion, broad Related Work, exhaustive per-language/per-domain tables, and
  secondary pipeline detail.
- Core floor: protect the construction-scaling-evaluation chain as the majority of main prose; if
  the venue is short, narrow the scale or move tables to supplement before shrinking those core
  sections below their proportional floor.

## Section And Proportional-Budget Reference

| Order | Candidate section | Share of main text | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | ~3-5% | State the real-world coverage gap, the resource and models built, the scale, and the impact result. |
| 1 | Introduction | ~10-16% | Motivate the real-world need (who is unserved by current technology), the approach, and contributions/releases. |
| 2 | Related Work | ~6-10% | Position against prior systems by coverage, data source, and real-world reach. |
| 3 | Data / Resource Construction | ~20-28% | Document the data source, the construction/alignment/curation pipeline (step by step), coverage, and quality filtering. |
| 4 | Models / Scaling | ~18-26% | Describe the models built and how they scale across the target population (e.g., multiple tasks or domains), with training details. |
| 5 | Practical-Impact Evaluation | ~18-26% | Evaluate against strong baselines on real benchmarks, report coverage/reach, and analyze errors across the population (e.g., by region/domain/subgroup). |
| 6 | Responsible Use / Broader Impact | ~4-8% | Discuss access, fairness across the served population, risks, and intended deployment. |
| 7 | Conclusion + Resource Release | ~3-5% | Restate the reach achieved and specify released models, data, and tooling. |
| Back | Appendix / Supplement | outside main budget | Full coverage tables, pipeline details, per-subgroup results, and release metadata. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- Lead from the real-world coverage gap, not from a model trick; the value is serving an underserved
  population or use case at scale.
- Close the loop: data source -> construction -> model scaling -> impact evaluation -> release.
  Reviewers distrust applied papers that only tune on a couple of clean datasets.
- Use strong baselines (not weak ones) and error analysis across the population; report where it
  underperforms.
- Make coverage/reach concrete (counts, populations, domains) and releases explicit.
- If the contribution is the data resource itself rather than its applied deployment, use
  `dataset-benchmark-paper.md`.
