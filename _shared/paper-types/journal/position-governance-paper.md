# Journal Position / Perspective / Governance Paper Type

Use this profile for journal papers whose main contribution is an argued position, perspective,
forward-looking agenda, or trustworthy-AI / ethics / governance synthesis built around a
human-centered or stakeholder framework. Representative shape: TPAMI human-centered perspectives
(e.g., a survey of user studies for model explanations that frames stakeholder needs, defines
evaluation dimensions such as trust/understanding/usability/collaboration, synthesizes evidence, and
derives design and governance implications).

## Section Structure (Paper Framework hard default)

This file gives the **default section list, order, naming, count, and budget** for this paper type.
The Paper Framework stage treats it as a **hard default, not loose inspiration**: by default,
reproduce the section table below exactly (its section column, in order) and quote it as the canonical
list in the Paper Framework's "Structure vs paper-type profile" comparison. This file does not
prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims, evidence, or citations.

Deviate only when the actual contribution, evidence, venue requirement, or explicit user request
genuinely cannot fit this structure — never merely because another layout seems "cleaner" or "more
standard". Every split, merge, rename, addition, or reorder must be surfaced and approved at the Paper
Framework checkpoint; silent structural deviation is a workflow violation.

## Length: Defer To The Venue Card

This is a journal paper. Take absolute length from the venue card and plan sections as proportions
first. The evidence-synthesis and implications sections carry the contribution. Also load
`_shared/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`.

## Priority Contract

- Primary core: Framework / Evaluation Dimensions.
- Evidence core: Evidence Synthesis and Design / Governance Implications.
- Compress first: Conclusion, broad Background / Related Work, repeated motivation, and secondary examples.
- Core floor: protect the framework, evidence synthesis, and implications chain; if the venue is
  short, narrow the position or evidence scope before shrinking those sections below their
  proportional floor.

## Section And Proportional-Budget Reference

| Order | Candidate section | Share of main text | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | ~3-5% | State the stakeholder need, the framework/dimensions, the evidence synthesized, and the implications. |
| 1 | Introduction | ~12-18% | Establish the stakeholder need and the gap between technical metrics and human/organizational outcomes; state the position and contributions. |
| 2 | Background / Related Work | ~8-14% | Position against prior perspectives and adjacent technical work; clarify the framing this paper advances. |
| 3 | Framework / Evaluation Dimensions | ~18-26% | Define the organizing framework: the dimensions, categories, or objectives (e.g., trust, understanding, usability, collaboration) used to structure the analysis. |
| 4 | Evidence Synthesis | ~22-30% | Synthesize the evidence along the framework (study designs, measures, findings); analyze what is and is not supported, including inconsistencies. |
| 5 | Design / Governance Implications | ~12-18% | Derive concrete, actionable implications: best practices, design guidelines, or governance/policy recommendations grounded in the evidence. |
| 6 | Future Directions | ~6-10% | Lay out the forward agenda and open problems. |
| 7 | Conclusion | ~3-5% | Restate the position, the framework, and the implications. |
| Back | Appendix | outside main budget | Full evidence tables, coding schemes, and extended analyses. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- Anchor on stakeholder needs and outcomes, not on whether a technique looks impressive; the move is
  from "is the artifact good?" to "do the intended humans/organizations benefit?".
- Keep technical metrics, human evidence, and design/governance recommendations in one coherent
  framework; that integration is the contribution.
- Recommendations must be traceable to the synthesized evidence, not asserted.
- If the paper is primarily a neutral literature taxonomy rather than an argued position, use
  `journal/survey-paper.md`.
