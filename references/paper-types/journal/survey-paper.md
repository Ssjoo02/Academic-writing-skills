# Journal Survey Paper Type

Use this profile for journal survey/review articles whose main contribution is a taxonomy and
synthesis of a field: motivation, a unified comparison of method families, an application map, and
trends with open questions. Representative shape: TPAMI surveys (e.g., a self-supervised learning
survey organizing generative/contrastive/hybrid families under common dimensions, mapping
applications, and naming key trends and open problems). Journal surveys are long and authoritative.

## Use Only As Section Planning Reference

This file is only a section and proportional-budget reference for building a Paper Framework. It is
not a fixed paper template and does not prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims,
experiments, or citations.

Adapt sections and budgets to the actual paper, venue, evidence, and user request. Do not copy this
structure mechanically. Merge, rename, split, shrink, or remove sections when the confirmed venue,
contribution, evidence package, or page budget requires it.

## Length: Defer To The Venue Card

This is a journal survey and is long by nature. Take absolute length from the venue card (e.g.,
TPAMI survey ~20 double-column pages; JMLR concise but complete). Plan sections as proportions first.
The taxonomy/synthesis is the bulk; do not let the introduction or background dominate. Also load
`references/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`.

## Section And Proportional-Budget Reference

| Order | Candidate section | Share of main text | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | ~2-4% | State scope, the organizing lens/taxonomy, the key trends, and open questions. |
| 1 | Introduction | ~8-12% | Motivate why another survey is needed, the novelty of the organizing perspective, and contributions. |
| 2 | Background / Scope and Method | ~8-12% | Define concepts, the survey scope, and (if systematic) the selection/corpus method and taxonomy-construction method. |
| 3 | Taxonomy / Method Families | ~35-45% | Organize the literature by families along consistent comparison dimensions (motivation, mechanism, assumptions, strengths/limits); compare across families rather than listing papers. |
| 4 | Application Map | ~12-18% | Map where the methods are used across domains/tasks, with what trade-offs. |
| 5 | Trends, Open Questions, Future Directions | ~10-16% | Distill the field's evolution, the cross-cutting limitations, and concrete open problems. |
| 6 | Conclusion | ~2-4% | Restate the organizing framework and its research implications. |
| End | Curated Resources | venue-dependent | Point to a curated, maintained resource list when applicable. |
| Back | Appendix | outside main budget | Full method/paper tables, selection details, and extended comparisons. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- A survey synthesizes; it must expose evolution, commonalities, and shared limitations across
  method families, not stack one-paragraph paper summaries.
- Use consistent comparison dimensions so families are actually comparable (a comparison table is
  usually load-bearing).
- Protect the taxonomy and the trends/open-questions sections; those carry the contribution.
- This is the journal survey profile. A short conference/tutorial survey can instead use the
  top-level `survey-paper.md`.
