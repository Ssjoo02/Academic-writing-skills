# Journal Dataset / Benchmark Paper Type

Use this profile for journal papers whose main contribution is a dataset and an associated task /
benchmark: a new task definition, a curated and annotated dataset, defined splits and metrics, and a
baseline leaderboard. Representative shape: TPAMI dataset papers (e.g., a motion-expression video
segmentation dataset that defines a new task, documents annotation and statistics, sets splits and
metrics, and benchmarks many existing methods plus a baseline).

## Use Only As Section Planning Reference

This file is only a section and proportional-budget reference for building a Paper Framework. It is
not a fixed paper template and does not prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims,
experiments, or citations.

Adapt sections and budgets to the actual paper, venue, evidence, and user request. Do not copy this
structure mechanically. Merge, rename, split, shrink, or remove sections when the confirmed venue,
contribution, evidence package, or page budget requires it.

## Length: Defer To The Venue Card

This is a journal paper. Take absolute length from the venue card and plan sections as proportions
first. Move full datasheets, annotation guides, and per-method tables to supplemental material. Also
load `references/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`.

## Section And Proportional-Budget Reference

| Order | Candidate section | Share of main text | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | ~3-5% | State the task, why existing datasets are insufficient, the dataset scale, and the benchmark finding. |
| 1 | Introduction | ~12-18% | Define the new task and why it matters, the limitation of prior datasets, the design goals, and contributions. |
| 2 | Related Work | ~8-12% | Compare prior datasets/benchmarks by task framing, coverage, annotation, and metrics. |
| 3 | Dataset Construction | ~25-33% | Data sources and collection, the annotation process and tooling, quality control, and dataset statistics/analysis. |
| 4 | Tasks, Splits, and Metrics | ~8-12% | Define the task settings, train/val/test splits (and any online evaluation), and the evaluation metrics. |
| 5 | Benchmark Experiments | ~20-28% | Benchmark existing methods and a proposed baseline; report the leaderboard and, crucially, failure cases that the dataset exposes. |
| 6 | Conclusion | ~3-5% | Restate the resource and task enabled and what the benchmark shows. |
| End | Limitations | venue-dependent | Coverage/annotation limits, bias and licensing, intended non-uses, ethical constraints. |
| Back | Appendix / Supplement | outside main budget | Datasheet, annotation guidelines, extra statistics, per-method tables, and examples. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- Define a task, not just a file release: show why the target cannot be solved by prior framings
  (e.g., requires cross-frame/temporal reasoning, not single-frame static cues).
- Protect annotation, quality-control, and statistics space; reviewers probe data quality first.
- Use baseline failure cases and a leaderboard to argue the benchmark will drive follow-up work.
- Provide an evaluation entry point (splits, metrics, and ideally an online server) so results are
  comparable.
- If the contribution is measuring existing models rather than releasing data, use
  `evaluation-benchmark-paper.md` instead.
