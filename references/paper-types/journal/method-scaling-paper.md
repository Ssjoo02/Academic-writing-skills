# Journal Method / Scaling Paper Type

Use this profile for journal papers whose main contribution is a method, training paradigm, or
recipe whose value is established by decomposing it into controllable variables and proving its
behavior with a large, systematic experimental matrix across scales and benchmarks. Representative
shape: JMLR scaling studies (e.g., instruction finetuning analyzed over task count, model size, and
chain-of-thought data, with multi-benchmark generalization and an open model release).

## Use Only As Section Planning Reference

This file is only a section and proportional-budget reference for building a Paper Framework. It is
not a fixed paper template and does not prescribe writing style, reviewer strategy, claims,
experiments, or citations.

Adapt sections and budgets to the actual paper, venue, evidence, and user request. Do not copy this
structure mechanically. Merge, rename, split, shrink, or remove sections when the confirmed venue,
contribution, evidence package, or page budget requires it.

## Length: Defer To The Venue Card

This is a journal paper. Do NOT use a conference soft page budget. Take absolute length from the
venue card and plan sections as proportions first. The defining feature of this type is a LARGE
experimental matrix; protect enough room for it and push secondary tables to supplement/appendix.
Also load `references/venues/journal-vs-conference.md`.

## Section And Proportional-Budget Reference

| Order | Candidate section | Share of main text | Section role |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Front | Abstract | ~3-5% | State the method, the variables studied, the headline scaling finding, and the released resource. |
| 1 | Introduction | ~12-16% | Motivate the question ("does X help, and along which axes?"), summarize the scaling findings, list contributions and releases. |
| 2 | Method / Variable Decomposition | ~15-22% | Define the method and decompose it into the controllable variables (e.g., data/task count, model size, data format, an added ingredient), plus the training and evaluation protocol. |
| 3 | Scaling Experiments | ~25-35% | The experimental matrix: vary each axis, report held-out performance, and isolate each variable's effect. This is the core evidence. |
| 4 | Component Ablations | ~10-15% | Ablate the key ingredient(s) to show necessity and interaction effects, not just aggregate gains. |
| 5 | Cross-Benchmark Generalization | ~10-15% | Show the finding transfers across benchmarks, model families, and prompting setups; report where it does not. |
| 6 | Discussion / Takeaways | ~6-10% | Summarize the scaling rules learned, practical guidance, and limits. |
| 7 | Resource Release | ~2-4% | Specify released checkpoints, data, and code, and how to use them. |
| Back | Appendix / Supplement | outside main budget | Full result tables, per-task breakdowns, hyperparameters, and additional axes. |

## Flexible Adjustment Notes

- Frame the contribution as controlled variables with a designed matrix, not a single training
  trick; reviewers reward the regularity, not the anecdote.
- Every performance claim names dataset, metric, model scale, and setup; bare aggregate numbers do
  not survive review.
- Keep main-text tables to the load-bearing comparisons; move exhaustive grids to the supplement.
- If the contribution is a single algorithm with a mechanism rather than a scaling study, consider a
  method paper structure (theory or conference method-paper) instead.
- State the released resources concretely; reusable artifacts are part of this type's value.
